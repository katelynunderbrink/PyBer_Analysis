# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to find ride share data by city type and creating a graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results

The differences in ride share data by city type:
- There are less Total Rides, total drivers and total fares as population density decreases. 
- Average Fare per driver and Fare per ride increases as population density decreases, with rural at 8$ per driver and urban at .70$ per driver. 
- Fare by City Type, no matter the city type, peaks before March. 

## Summary
### Business Recommendations
- Increase drivers in Rural areas
